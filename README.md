## Overview

Users should be able to:

- Easily recongnize the web page that was cloned due to its exact resemblance.

- should be asthetically pleasing to viewers.

Note: i didn't add more sections because the concept of what i was building was already established and responsive.

## My process
single handedly written from scratch with no imported code or source code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
